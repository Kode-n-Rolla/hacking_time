<h2> Detailed Methodology: </h2>
<ol>
    <li> Reconnaissance - the process of gathering information about a company's infrastructure and vulnerabilities in order to determine what actions could be taken to compromise it
    <li> Weaponization - the process of creating and preparing software and tools by an actor that can be used to launch attacks against a company's infrastructure
    <li> Delivery - the process of delivering software to devices within a company's network
    <li> Exploitation - the process of exploiting vulnerabilities in a company's infrastructure, which were discovered during the reconnaissance phase, in order to gain unauthorized access
    <li> Installation - the process of installing malicious software on computers or servers within a company's network to establish a persistent presence and maintain the gained access in the system
    <li> Command and control - the process of establishing a connection between the compromised computer and the controlling software or command-and-control server operated by an attacker, which enables the attacker to remotely control the computer
    <li> Actions on objective - the process of carrying out the objectives by the perpetrator, which may involve activities such as data theft, espionage, malicious actions, and other actions that can cause harm to the company's infrastructure
</ol>
