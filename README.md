My pentesting cheat sheet, where I publish "hotkey" tools and the same things.

  - commands, for example command to connect to Windows or command, which download file from attacker machine to Windows victim through shell
  - some kind of payloads
  - helpful sites
  - resume info about my Stars on the gibhub, where real professionals do show their work
